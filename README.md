# DEEP-LEARNING-PROJECT
This deep learning project focuses on developing an intelligent model capable of classifying images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective is to train a model that can accurately identify and categorize images into predefined classes. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is particularly effective for tasks involving unstructured data such as images, audio, and text. The project involves several key steps, including data collection, preprocessing, model design, training, validation, and evaluation. A large dataset of labeled images is used for training, and the data is augmented to increase its diversity and improve model performance. The CNN architecture is built using TensorFlow or PyTorch, leveraging layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to learn hierarchical features from the images. The model is trained using backpropagation and an appropriate optimizer, such as Adam, to minimize the loss function. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model. The final output is a trained model that can predict the class of new, unseen images with high accuracy. This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in image classification and can be extended to real-world applications such as medical imaging, agriculture, and object detection.
